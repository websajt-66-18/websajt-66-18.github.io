	  <p><u><b>Tokyo</b></u> 
	  </br>
       Tokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, 
	   consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
	  </br>
       Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there.
	   A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo 
	   ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.
	  </br>
       Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, 
	   historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

	  <p><u><b>Seoul</b></u> 
	  </br>
	    It is hard to know what to make of South Korea; few are aware of what a modern and fascinating country it is. 
		Often overshadowed by the histrionics of its sibling to the north, it has astounded economists with its rags-to-riches transformation.
        The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945, after the Second World War; by the early 1960s, the southern side had a per capita GDP far less than that of its socialist sister, and a primitive standard of living. 
		Since then, however, through hard work and some serious creative planning, South Korea has become a cultural superpower and the world’s 13th-largest economy.
	  </br>
	    It is perhaps the only country where you will notice a remarkable physical difference between each generation: the elders come in at around 5ft, hunched over from years of manual labour;
		there is a middle generation of hard-working but well-groomed conservatives about six inches taller; and the well-nourished youngsters often top 6ft.
        You might think the younger citizens would be arrogant about the country’s achievements, but they are not. 
		Though deeply patriotic, they are still fascinated by the Western world; expect to be wedged between Grandma and the new baby for a family snap, drawn into broken-English conversations on the subway, 
		and greeted with a shy but welcoming smile wherever you go.
	  </br>
		Seoul fosters all kinds of quaint traditions. A new couple, for example, is not taken seriously until observed wearing full matching outfits; your dog can’t be seen outside until it has dyed-pink ears and booties;
		a night out is not complete without disco bowling; and it is not unheard of to have your fried chicken served in a (clean) urinal at a toilet-themed restaurant.
		This is a culture full of fascinating contradictions; the remnants of Confucianism have teamed up with rampant consumerism to form a slightly confused society. There remains a strong hierarchical respect among the population 
		(grammar changes when you address elders, and some seats on the subway are strictly reserved for the elderly), yet the streets are kept clean by destitute old people without family support, who cart waste and recycling to centres and get paid a pittance. 
		(Thankfully, a welfare state is now emerging, and it looks as though this imbalance will slowly be corrected.)
