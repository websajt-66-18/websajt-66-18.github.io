	  <p><u><b>New York City</b></u> 
	  </br>
         When Sinatra sang: "If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere,” about this city of eight million inhabitants, he wasn't kidding.
		 People don't come to New York City to relax. Instead, they gravitate to Gotham to be the best of the best in their professions. 
		 And for visitors, that means everyone – from chefs to performers to bartenders to artists – are at the top of their game, making this bustling Metropolis truly one of the world's greatest playgrounds.
		 Manhattan may still be the core of the Big Apple, but the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens have been grabbing some attention of late with great dining, shopping and nightlife scenes of their own.
	  </br>
	    <b>Where to go</b>
		</br>
         This gargantuan 305ft Gallic-designed sculpture is one of the world's most identifiable icons.
		 The first thing you notice: she's shorter than you think, but once you're standing at her base she looks majestic.
		 Don't miss the second-floor museum dedicated to all things Lady Liberty (it includes the original torch). Free entrance, but visitors must get a time-stamped ticket.
		</br>
		<b>Discover New York's real jazz scene</b>
		</br>
        Legendary local clubs like the Village Vanguard and Blue Note are known throughout the world and listed in every guide book, but this basement jazz club, Mezzro, 
		is frequented by real jazz lovers who come to hear up-and-coming (as well as established) musicians while sipping Manhattans and snacking on charcuterie and cheese.
	    </br>
	    <b>Soak up the views from the Empire State Building</b>
        There probably won't be a giant ape at the top, but the views from the 86th-floor observation deck will take your breath away.
		Completed in 1931 and consisting of 60,000 tons of steel, the Empire State Building was the tallest skyscraper in the world until the World Trade Towers were erected in the Seventies.
	    </br>
	    <b>Take a boat cruise around Manhattan</b>
        Hop on a three-hour Circle Line Best of NYC (Full Island Cruise) to see three rivers, seven bridges and the extraordinary forest-covered cliffs overlooking the Hudson around Fort Tryon Park, 
		in the north-west corner of the island.
		You will see a Manhattan you did not know existed. Food and refreshments are available on board, and the live narration is usually very entertaining.
	    </br> 
        <b>Browse – then eat – some modern art</b>
        Picasso, Dali, Kahlo, Matisse and Warhol are just a few of the names you'll find at the Museum of Modern Art, which is flooded with natural light and an absolute pleasure to wander through. 
		Keep an eye open for outré pieces by New York artists, such as Dan Graham's two-way mirror glass pavilion installation in the sculpture garden. 
		In-house restaurant, The Modern, serves up edible art on a plate that tastes terrific.

	  <u><b>Boston</b></u> 
	  </br>
        Whenever you visit, Boston really does have something for everyone. Founded in 1630, this old lady is not stuck in the past.
		Georgian-style housesare balanced by soaring glass and steel skyscrapers and venerable museumsby edgy contemporary galleries. 
		As in European cities, half the fun is exploring the different neighbourhoods: posh Beacon Hill, the Italian NorthEnd and Back Bay, with its shops and cafés. 
		Everyone walks everywhere; when your feet protest, hop on the ‘T’, the public transport system. Getting to know the locals is easy: just ask about politics and baseball. 
		With its harbour, riverside and parks, everyone enjoys the outdoor life. 
		Think walks and bike rides, picnics and concerts. Not forgetting the shopping, from major international designer names and in-city outlets to one-of- a-kindshops. 
		And there is always some sort of festival; after all, there are 250,000 students in this buzzing city.
	  </br>
	    <b>The Freedom Trail</b>
        For an easy lesson in American history, walk this 2.5-mile route that passes 16 sites, all with tales to tell. 
		Many are must-sees in their own right, such as the Old State House, the Paul Revere House and Old North Church. 
	  </br> 
        <b>Beacon Hill</b>
        With its elegant homes, gas lighting, brick pavements and flower boxes, this area seems unchanged in 200 years. 
		At the top stands the gold-domed Massachusetts State House; charming Acorn Street and Louisburg Square (pronounced ‘Lewisburg’) are musts for photographers.
		Explore on an informative guided walk, such as the Boston by Foot regular 90-minute tours from April to November.
		<b>John F Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum/ Edward M Kennedy Institute for the US Senate</b>
		The life, times, leadership and legacy of JFK are explored in a dramatic waterside complex. The videos and displays bring the 1950s and 60s to life.
		Open since 2015 is the Edward M Kennedy Institute for the US Senate, an inter-active “laboratory of democracy” next door.
		As well as a full-scale replica of Senator Ted Kennedy’s Senate office, with photos and artefacts from his 47-year tenure, highlights include a full-scale representation of the US Senate Chamber.
		</br>
		<b>Boston Duck Tour</b>
		Board an amphibious vehicle that rolls along the streets, then splashes into the Charles River.
		Your driver/guide, perhaps Vincent Van Duck or Major Tom Foolery, gives a light-hearted, 80-minute version of Boston’s history.
