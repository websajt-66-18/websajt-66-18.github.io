	  <p><b>Tourism</b> is that branch of travel that goes deeper to exploration. Instead of just traveling places, many instead for good reason to spend time to get to know the country they are visiting meaning the people, the culture, the food and not just the bright spot on the map.
       The more technology prevails, the less we are in touch with each other which makes tourism and travel as its extension so much more crucial so people realize that what they see on tv is not just a show but reality.
       Tourism is an economical factors for many countries especially the ones on the way. We are seeing borders closing or trying to be enacted but a wall really!
       Tourism unite nations and people by bringing our difference to a good eye. It is the fact that who do not travel remains uneducated despite the awards and title on its name. I learn more exploring the world than sitting on a bench.
       Remember that education( school) takes your mind places but travel takes your mind and body.

	  <p>Although many of us have been “tourists” at some point in our lives, defining what tourism actually is can be difficult. Tourism is the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business or other purposes for not more than one consecutive year.
       Tourism is a dynamic and competitive industry that requires the ability to adapt constantly to customers’ changing needs and desires, as the customer’s satisfaction, safety and enjoyment are particularly the focus of tourism businesses.

       <b>Outbound Tourism</b>
	   </br>
	   </br>
       Outbound tourism is what you may be most familiar with. It involves the people going from British Columbia to other provinces, territories or countries. For example, going to Hawaii for a holiday is considered outbound tourism.

       <b>Inbound Tourism</b>
	   </br>
	   </br>
       The tourists coming to BC from other places are called inbound tourists. BC competes in a global market to attract tourists from the United States, Japan, Germany and many other countries. The industry also implements marketing campaigns aimed at attracting travellers from other parts of Canada, as well as from within British Columbia.
       </br>
       </br>	   
       <b>Domestic Tourism</b>
       Approximately half of the tourists in BC each year are actually from within the province.  BC Stats and Destination BC consider those travelling beyond their usual environment (typically more than 80 km from home) for business or for pleasure to be tourists.

       </br>	   
       <b>Tourism Sectors</b>
	   </br>
       There are different ways to measure the size of the tourism industry, as tourism does not conform to the usual ways that industries are defined, such as manufacturing, forestry and other industries. Tourism constitutes a wide variety of sectors that provide diverse products and services to visitors. However, these businesses also provide products and services to local residents.
